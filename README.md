# Fabrice Ortega, iOS Developer.

Hi there, I am Fabrice, an iOS Developer.
After several years as an Engineer in the automotive industry, it was time for me to learn something new, and most importantly something that fits more to my aspirations, that's why I started this amazing journey to become a mobile app developer !
Please check out the projects I uploaded on my GitHub, here is a sample :




## [KanjiMemo](https://github.com/FabriceOrtega/KanjiMemo)

I love Japan and I am learning the language. Japanese "writing system" is complex, the most complex part is without a doubt the Kanji, these Chinese characters. With the KanjiMemo app, you can learn the meanings of those Kanji by playing with a quizz with swipe cards (tinder style). With the repetition of those small quizz, it will be easy to remember the Kanji.

## [Reciplease](https://github.com/FabriceOrtega/Reciplease)

Reciplease is an app which has been developped during my OpenClassRooms training. The aim of this app is to search for recipes according to the ingredients that the user is entering. The user has also the possibility to set a recipe as favorite.

Le Baluchon is an app which has been developped during my OpenClassRooms training. The aim of this app is to compare the weather between two locations. The app can also translate between two languages and calculate an amount in anoter currency with the current rate.
